LIRI readme
===========

LIRI is a CLI applet to pull specific types of data from Twitter, Spotify, or OMDb.

This guide is written assuming that your current working directory is the directory that contains liri.js.

Launching and using LIRI
------------------------

To launch LIRI, simply run `node liri.js` in a shell.  This version should be extremely straightforward to use, as its interface is provided by Inquirer.  Therefore, no additional instructions are needed in this README.md =p

What has been removed?
----------------------

- The ability to act on random.txt has been removed.
- `my-tweets` has been removed
- The built-in help functionality has been removed (it's probably not necessary, anyway)
